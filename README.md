- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Guilherme Elias

I'm a mechanical engineer who graduated from CEFET-MG in Brazil. I've worked at MRS LogÃ­stica S/A, FCA (Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) and Volkswagen do Brasil.
I'm currently studying Data Science and Data Analysis with Python, R, Power BI and a few other tools.
I am taking an MBA Analytics Data Science course offered by FIA (Faculdade Instituto de AdministraÃ§Ã£o) also here in Brazil.

The goal of this hub is to publish my individual projects, that includes data science projects such as exploratory analysis and modelling, Power BI dashboards of the data I work with and some other projects I wish to publish here.
